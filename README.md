Pneumonia chest Xray Classification


Introduction
The Chest X-ray Pneumonia Detection project employs a powerful machine learning algorithm known as the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify chest X-ray images as either normal or indicative of pneumonia. This innovative application allows users to input the URL of a chest X-ray image from any web browser, enabling quick and accurate predictions regarding the presence of pneumonia.

Dataset
The project's dataset was meticulously collected using the Bing Image Downloader. It comprises a diverse set of chest X-ray images, expertly labeled as either normal or pneumonia cases.

Model
For this critical binary classification task, we harnessed the capabilities of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. SVM's prowess in classifying complex datasets makes it an ideal choice for this medical diagnostic application.
